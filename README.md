# Hackerrank Interview Preparation Kit

This is a repository to store my answers to the Hackerrank Interview Preparation Kit questions.

The answers are initially going to be in Typescript, but I intend to add Python/Java solutions in the near future.

All solutions are approved with 100% test success.

## Installation

Install project dependencies by running:

```bash
  npm install
```

## Running scripts

To run a script, first you need to compile it:

```
